## Folder Structure 
The folder structure was taught in Web Development course. It is a basic structure and we can update and evolve as we progress.

### Asset

This folder will contain the images, external/downloaded fonts and css stylesheet

### Controller

This folder will contain the backend works that are not visible in the website such as php, javascript (not all JS)

### View

This will be the frontend of the website and will contain the HTML, JS.

### Model

The data that are uploaded or downloaded are will be in this folder. Right now we will use this as testing purpose. Uploading image or file in the website, we can emulate this folder as server and the uploaded files will be saved here.
